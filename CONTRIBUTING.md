## How Can I Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for the containers library. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.  Frequently, helpful information includes operating system, version, compiler used, API, interface, and some details about the function or operation being performed.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Submitting a pull request
Typically you would want to submit a pull request against the develop branch.  That branch gets merged into master periodically but the develop branch is the active development branch where all the code is tested and merged before making a release.  There is a [Pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) that will guide you through the needed information.
