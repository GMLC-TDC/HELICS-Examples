Created on 9/15/2020

This is a simple EV federate that models a set of EV terminals in an
EV charging garage. Each terminal can support charging at levels 1, 2,
and 3 but the EVs that come to charge have a randomly assigned charging
level.

Managing these terminals is a centralized EV Controller that receives from
the EV the current SOC and sends a command back to the terminal to continue
charging or stop charging (once the EV is full). Once an EV is full, a new
EV is moved into the charging terminal (with a randomly assigned charging
level) and begins charging.
