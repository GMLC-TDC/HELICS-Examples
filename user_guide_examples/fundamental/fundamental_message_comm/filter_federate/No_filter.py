Created on Monday Sept 14 13:32 2020
(The day I should have been camping but, you know, all of the West Coast
was on fire so I didn't.)

This is a simple filter federate designed to show how such a federate
is written and connected to the federation as a whole.

Ideally, all the filter functionality that is needed could be covered either
by native HELICS filters or existing communication simulation tools (ns-3).
Writing a new simulation tool should be the third and last option. This
federate contains some basic functionality that can be useful to do
slightly fancy things (delays, data contention, cyber security) but
doesn't contain a lot of functionality needed for real communications
network simulation (routing being at the top of the list). All that to
say, this is a demonstration more of how filter federates work than an
example to be followed.
