This is a simple EV charge controller federate that manages the charging at
a set of charging terminals in a hypothetical EV garage. It receives periodic
SOC messages from each EV (associated with a particular charging terminal)
and sends back a message indicating whether the EV should continue charging
or not (based on whether it is full).
