This example demonstrates the use of a combination federate, one that transmits information with the rest of the federation via publications/subscriptions (value exchanges) and endpoints (message exchange). A full description of the example can be found in the [HELICS User Guide](https://docs.helics.org/en/latest/user-guide/examples/fundamental_examples/fundamental_combo.html).
