# HELICS User Guide Advanced Topics - HELICS-FMI/FMU Example

This example demonstrates the usage of [HELICS-FMI](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS-FMI) to run a co-simulation in helics with FMUs. The example duplicates the fundamental default example, except that the battery model has been replaced with an FMU. A full description of the example can be found in the [HELICS User Guide](https://docs.helics.org/en/latest/user-guide/examples/advanced_examples/advanced_fmu.html).
