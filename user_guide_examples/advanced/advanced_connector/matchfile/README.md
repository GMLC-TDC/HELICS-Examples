# HELICS User Guide Advanced Topic - Connector Federate Using a Matchfile

The use of a JSON-formatted matchfile is curently not working and thus that example does not work. [HELICS-Examples issue #124](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS-Examples/issues/124) has been filed to track this example.

This example demonstrates the use of a connector federate and matchfile to define a federation. A full description of the example can be found in the [HELICS User Guide](https://docs.helics.org/en/latest/user-guide/examples/advanced_examples/advanced_connector/something.html).
