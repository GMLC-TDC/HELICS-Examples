# HELICS User Guide Advanced Topics - Broker Hierarchies

This example does not currently work. [HELICS-Examples issue #125](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS-Examples/issues/125) is tracking this example.

This example demonstrates how to implement a broker that can use multiple messaging technologies (ZMQ, MPI, etc) when required by the computing environment. A full description of the example can be found in the [HELICS User Guide](https://docs.helics.org/en/latest/user-guide/examples/advanced_examples/advanced_brokers_multibroker.html).
