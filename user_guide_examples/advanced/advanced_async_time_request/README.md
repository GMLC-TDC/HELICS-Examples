# HELICS User Guide Advanced Topics - Asynchronous Time Request

This example is the base example for many of the other examples covered in the Advanced Topics portion of the HELICS User Guide. The example builds on top of the advanced default example and implements an asynchronous (non-blocking) time request. A full description of the example can be found in the [HELICS User Guide (dummy link for now)](https://docs.helics.org/).
